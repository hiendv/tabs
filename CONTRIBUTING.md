# Contributing
When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue, email, or any other method with the owners of this repository before making a change. Please note we have a code of conduct, please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## Pull Request Process
### Step 0: Set up your local environment
To get started, you will need to have git installed locally. Once you have git and are sure you have all of the necessary dependencies, it's time to create a fork. Before getting started, it is recommended to configure git so that it knows who you are:
```bash
git config --global user.name "J. Random User"
git config --global user.email "j.random.user@example.com"
```

### Step 1: Fork
Fork the project on GitHub and clone your fork.
```bash
git clone git@github.com:username/tabs.git
cd tabs
git remote add upstream https://github.com/hiendv/tabs.git
git fetch upstream
```

### Step 2: Make a branch
As a best practice to keep your development environment as organized as possible, create local branches to work within. These should also be created directly off of the master branch.
```bash
git checkout -b fix-something -t upstream/master
```

### Step 3: Install the dependencies & Bootstrap the project
```bash
npm install
npm run setup
```

### Step 4: Write some code & build
When you are happy with your changes, run `npm run build`.
If you don't want to repeat the process of linting & building from time to time, run `npm start` which should concurrently start **watching** and **serving**.

### Step 5: Tests
It's easy, `npm test`. Want coverage reports also? `npm run coverage`.

### Step 6: Commit
It is a recommended best practice to keep your changes as logically grouped as possible within individual commits. There is no limit to the number of commits any single PR may have, and many contributors find it easier to review changes that are split across multiple commits.
```bash
git add the/changed/files
git commit
```

### Step 7: Rebase
As a best practice, once you have committed your changes, it is a good idea to use `git rebase` (not `git merge`) to synchronize your work with the upstream repository.
```bash
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/master
```

This ensures that your working branch has the latest changes from upstream/master.

### Step 8: Push
Once you are sure your commits are ready to go, begin the process of opening a Pull Request by pushing your working branch to your fork on GitHub.
```bash
git push origin my-branch
```

### Step 9: Opening the Pull Request
Once opened, Pull Requests are usually reviewed within a few  hours or days.

### Step 10: Discuss and update
You will probably get feedback or requests for changes to your Pull Request. This is a big part of the submission process so don't be discouraged! Some contributors may sign off on the Pull Request right away, others may have more detailed comments or feedback. This is a necessary part of the process in order to evaluate whether the changes are correct and necessary.

To make changes to an existing Pull Request, make the changes to your local branch, add a new commit with those changes, and push those to your fork. GitHub will automatically update the Pull Request.
```bash
git add another/changed/file
git commit
git push origin my-branch
```

It is also frequently necessary to synchronize your Pull Request with other changes that have landed in master.
```bash
git fetch --all
git rebase origin/master
git push --force-with-lease origin my-branch
```

If you happen to make a mistake in any of your commits, do not worry. You can amend the last commit (for example if you want to change the commit log).
```bash
git add any/changed/files
git commit --amend
git push --force-with-lease origin my-branch
```

Feel free to post a comment in the Pull Request to ping reviewers if you are awaiting an answer on something.
Thank you.
